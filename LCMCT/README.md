1. Local color transfer from reference image is achieved but there could be a possibility for global transfer.
2. To counter balance that effect there comes an extra processing step which helps in transferring useful information from reference image.
3. However, my observation here is algorithm primarly depends on reference image, if there exists a reference image with high red intensities, underwater images also results in high red intensities which results unreal.
