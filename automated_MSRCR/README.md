# Multiscale retinex with color restoration

## Description
Python implementation of multiscale retinex color restoration with automation.

1. Proposed method chooses upper and lower clipping points.
2. The frequency of occurrence of pixel value '0â€™ in the enhanced image will be found. The lower and upper clipping points are obtained accordingly; y=0.05 is found to be an optimum value for most of the images by doing like this(clipping) 5 percent of pixels on either side of the histogram are discarded.
